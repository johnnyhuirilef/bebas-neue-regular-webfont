# BEBAS NEUE WEB FONT
The Bebas Neue web font, packaged for Bower

## FONT INFORMATION
Bebas Neue is a sans serif font family based on the original Bebas Neue free font by Ryoichi Tsunekawa. It has grown in popularity and become something like the “Helvetica of the free fonts”.
Now the family has four new members – Thin, Light, Book, and Regular – added by Fontfabric Type Foundry.

The new weights stay true to the style and grace of Bebas with the familiar clean lines, elegant shapes, a blend of technical straightforwardness and simple warmth which make it uniformly proper for web, print, commerce and art.
